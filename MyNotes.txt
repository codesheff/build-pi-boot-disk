To do , 

Keep checking the cloud init file setup works

target partition should match the current one
( there's a script to compare - utility/compare-cloud-init.sh)

Once that's done..
Check if you can use the new disk to boot up and connect


If that works.. look into recreating filesystem from Backup
 ( probably using reset script that already gets put in place)
 and also retriggering the cloud init

 Can this be done during the boot process?( ie. before partition is mounted?)
